    <h1>About Swipestore</h1>
    <p>
      DePauw University currently offers weekly meal plans that include 14-18
      swipes. Unused swipes, on the other hand, are forfeited and reset weekly,
      perpetuating the unfortunate trend of swipes going to waste due to varying
      levels of hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, a significant number of meal plan-free students seek to
      purchase swipes for less than the market value of about $8 per swipe.
      Swipestore is a platform that allows students to exchange swipes for cash,
      preserving their monetary value and reducing waste. This initiative
      fosters an organic marketplace driven by supply and demand dynamics,
      benefiting both buyers and sellers in a win-win scenario.

      This project will focus on the visuals of the website, leaving out a lot
      of functionality around buying, selling, and filtering as further features
      to be implemented.
